/* voluntary questions:
Right-associativity would be reached by reversing the direction with which we process the array/list.

the second "fold-fct" is not recursion. It is simply the parameter of the recursive call of apply.

I believe the requirements to be met. Examples would be any mathematical operations. I forgot how the fold/join/map
functions worked as I didn't fully pay attention during that lecture, so I apologise for not being able to give a full answer here.
